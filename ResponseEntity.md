# Response Entity

`ResponseEntity` is a class in **Spring Framework** (part of Spring Boot) that represents an HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body. It is not a built-in Java feature but comes from the **Spring Web dependency** (`spring-web`).


## **What is `ResponseEntity<>`?**

* `ResponseEntity<>` is a **wrapper around an HTTP response** that allows you to:
  1. Set the **HTTP status code**.
  2. Include **headers**.
  3. Attach a **response body (data object)**.
