# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Spring Boot

#### **üîç Step 1: What Are We Trying to Solve?**

When building applications, we often need **common functionalities** like:

* Logging
* Security checks
* Performance monitoring
* Transaction management

Without AOP, we **repeatedly write the same code** in multiple places:

```java
class PaymentService {
    void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Logging: Payment started"); // Common logic  
        // Actual business logic  
        System.out.println("Processing payment...");  
        System.out.println("Logging: Payment completed"); // Common logic  
    }
}

```

üö® **Problems:**

* **Code Duplication** ‚Üí Logging/security is repeated in multiple classes.
* **Tight Coupling** ‚Üí Mixing core business logic with cross-cutting concerns.
* **Difficult Maintenance** ‚Üí Changing logging logic requires updating multiple files.


#### **üîç Step 2: What Are the Core Principles Behind the Solution?**

‚úÖ **Separate Business Logic from Common Concerns**
‚úÖ **Apply Common Logic Dynamically Without Code Duplication**

---

#### **üîç Step 3: What If We Remove Assumptions and Rebuild from Scratch?**

* **Assumption:** "Logging/security must be written inside each method."
* **Reframe:** "What if we define logging/security once and apply it wherever needed?"
* **New Idea:** A mechanism that **injects cross-cutting concerns automatically**.

---

#### **üîç Step 4: The Birth of AOP**

AOP allows us to **define cross-cutting logic separately** and apply it dynamically.

With AOP, we can rewrite our `PaymentService`**without mixing concerns:**

```java
class PaymentService {
    void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Processing payment..."); // Business logic only  
    }
}

```

And define a **separate** logging mechanism:

```java
@Aspect
@Component
class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(* PaymentService.processPayment(..))")
    public void logBefore() {
        System.out.println("Logging: Payment started");
    }

    @After("execution(* PaymentService.processPayment(..))")
    public void logAfter() {
        System.out.println("Logging: Payment completed");
    }
}

```

‚úÖ **Now, logging applies automatically without modifying `PaymentService`!**
